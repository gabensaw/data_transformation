work to do:

-Read in the following file in python
-Transform it
-Save it to a new file
-Upload your code and clean file to github

Notes: 
The transformations should remove any rows with missing values, and any rows where the student was absent for all assessments. The columns Zscore, gender, and syllabus should also be removed. Take the three date columns and concatenate them into one (birth_day, birth_month, birth_year -> birthdate).
 
My work:
I described all the steps I followed in reading the file, writing it to the transformation dataframe object, and writing the result to a new csv file using comments in the file data_transformation.py
